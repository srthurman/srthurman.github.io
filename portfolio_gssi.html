                        <h4><strong>The Challenge</strong></h4>
                        <p>In 2011, the U.S. Census Bureau's Geographic Support System Initiative (GSS-I) program was launching, but the Production Control System (PCS) needed to support the program was delayed by 6 months.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4><strong>The Approach</strong></h4>
                        <p>Create a lightweight, web-based, database supported system to support the GSS-I team.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h4><strong>Goals</strong></h4>
                        <ul class="unordered-list">
                            <li>Identify the primary needs of the GSS-I team members.</li>
                            <li>Design a clear information architecture to facilitate key user interactions, including data entry and report generation.</li>
                            <li>Design a database architecture which aligns with the full PCS architecture to facilitate ease of migration.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h4><strong>Duration</strong></h4>
                        <p>8 months</p>

                        <p>The GSS-I  had a hard start date, but due to unforseen circumstances, wouldn't have a production system to support it until early six months after that date. I was approached by the team running the GSS-I and the engineering team for help in creating a temporary but production quality solution. I was the division's lead BI Analyst, which gave me access to both the databases and application building tools needed to put together something quickly.</p>

                        <h2>Phase 1: User Research</h2>
                            <p>I started by meeting with the members of the GSS-I, to learn more about what each of them needed from the new system. This included:</p>
                            <ul class="unordered-list">
                                <li>What data will you be inputting and how often?</li>
                                <li>What data will you need to edit?</li>
                                <li>What types of reports will you need?</li>
                                <li>How many users will be accessing the system?</li>
                                <li>Are there restrictions on who can access and edit certain data?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I also met with the engineering team who would be building the full PCS. I wanted to learn the details of their vision for the PCS. The goal was to migrate data out of the temporary PCS (temp-PCS) I built into the main PCS when the time came. Thus, temp-PCS didn't need to have an identical back end, but did need to be designed with this migration in mind.</p>

                        <h2>Phase 2: Interaction Design & Usability Testing</h2>
                            <p>Given the limited time frame to get things live and my lack of experience with front-end code at the time, I chose Oracle's Application Express (APEX) to build the UI. APEX provided a drag and drop interface to build the UI, and could seamlessly integrate with the Oracle database on the back end. </p>

                            <!-- insert image of apex info/logo -->

                            <p>After sketching out the layout of key pages and quickly creating a prototype database, I put together a working, draft version of the temp-PCS. Using this "live prototype" for usability testing was ideal as making changes was extremely fast, giving myself and users the freedom to explore alternate designs while ensuring all possible paths worked as intended.</p>

                        <h2>Phase 3: Launch & Iterate</h2>
                            <p>After several rounds of iterating and testing with users, the system was ready to use shortly before the launch date. As the users started using the system with live data, more needed changes were identified. I was able to quickly incorporate these changes since the temp-PCS wasn't an "official" PCS, meaning it wasn't subject to the time-intensive steps of our division's waterfall driven software release process. I continued iterating based on user feedback over the subsequent six months.</p>

                            <p>The added benefit of this process was I could bring back all of these learnings to the engineering team in charge of the PCS. The PCS would be subject to the waterfall software release process, so even the smallest change that could be made before going live would save weeks of time.</p>

                        <h2>Phase 4: Transfer Ownership</h2>
                            <p>Once the PCS engineering team had their system ready, I worked with them to ensure the data were migrated correctly, and appropriate downtime was scheduled to minimize disruptions to the users. We kept both systems running concurrently for several weeks to ensure there were no hiccups with the PCS, before shutting temp-PCS down permanently.</p>

                            <p><strong>Users can't know everything they need in advance.</strong> This project was my first big lesson on this topic. My career up until that point had only been in the federal government, and only driven by waterfall software release. I had assumed you could simply ask users what they need, and they should be able to tell you in advance. Working with the users to define and discover their needs was critical in shifting my thinking away from that model.</p>
