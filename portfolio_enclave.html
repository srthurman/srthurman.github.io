            <h4><strong>The Challenge</strong></h4>
                <p>Gender non-conforming (GNC*) people need a way to find places to go without compromising their physical or psychological safety.</p>
                <p><em>*The term GNC refers to anyone whose appearance, actions and/or gender identity don't match with cultural norms based on their biological sex.</em></p>
                <br>

                <p>Going into the interviews, I had my own definition of gendered places (primarily bathrooms, locker rooms, dressing rooms and clothing stores/departments). I knew my definition was an assumption, and wanted to avoid simply leading my interviewees to validate those assumptions. Thus, I focused on learning which places made my interviewees comfortable vs un-comfortable without any limiting factors on the type. From that I hoped to get insight into a more encompassing definition of gendered places.</p>

                <p>My interviews revealed that I was incorrect with my internal definition of gendered places. Great! Interviews, like usability tests, are most interesting and valuable when they reveal that you would have gone in the wrong direction without them.</p>

                            <p>I also conducted a competitive analysis of several other services and apps available which allow for sharing information and/or social connections.

            <h2 class="text-heading">Phase 2: Interaction Design</h2>

                <h3 class="text-heading">Design Strategy</h3>
                    <p>Based on Alex's needs and the offerings in similar apps, I decided on the following list of priorities for the MVP.</p>

                    <p><strong>First, emphasize finding and sharing good experiences over bad.</strong> Good experiences are more actionable than bad. If the world is an unknown place, with a base assumption that any place new could be un-comfortable, then sharing bad experiences doesn't answer the critical question "where should I go?". These will be important, but not a critical feature for the MVP.</p>

                    <p><strong>Second, allow knowing personal details of other reviewers while maintaining anonymity. </strong>This one is a little bit of a "wicked problem". It's important for Alex to understand how much of their background other reviewers share, as that's a proxy for how well those folks experiences will map to Alex's. However, it's also important that Alex not have to provide personally identifiable information (PII) to the app as they're concerned about their privacy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Third, make sharing the minimum amount of useful information in a review as frictionless as possible. </strong>To encourage Alex to give back to the community of other users, I need to define the smallest bit of useful information to share, and make that process as easy as possible.</p>
                    <br>
                <h3 class="text-heading">Information Architecture part 1: User Flow</h3>
                    <p>In line with the first priority listed above, I developed a primary user flow focused on Alex finding a place they want to go and getting there. This flow is relatively straight forward, but it was still important to understand the decision points Alex will be faced with. Mapping the flow also helps prevent designing a dead end, where users would end up stuck and frustrated.</p>

                                <p>Based on the primary flow above, along with the other two MVP priorities, I created a list of ~30 proposed features. I then conducted an open card sort with several new participants. Performing an open card sort was important for revealing how people mentally classify the cards, and what specific terms they use. As I saw in the interview stage, limiting folks based on my own ideas for categories could be detrimental to the entire project.</p>

                <h3 class="text-heading">Wireframing & Prototyping</h3>
                    <p>Time to start creating prototypes! I started with hand drawn, low-fidelity wireframes to play with ideas for some of the main screens. I took the versions I liked best, and translated those into digital wireframes using Sketch. I then used InVision to create interactive prototypes, in order to evaluate how people engaged with the proposed screens and flows. InVision was a great choice as it allows direct upload of screens from Sketch (with the Craft plugin), and is easy to learn, thus minimizing time needed to set up the prototype itself, and maximizing time available for testing.</p>

                    <p>The product name, Enclave, emerged from reflection on the purpose of the app as serving a niche group of people within the larger culture. </p>

                <h2 class="text-heading">Phase 3: Usability Testing & Iteration</h2>
                    <p>The first round of testing was incredibly valuable. It revealed big opportunities for improving the key functionality for the app - sharing "favorites" (aka places where people had good experiences). I was using a 5 star rating system, similar to other apps like Yelp and Google. For Enclave, that ended up not being the best choice for the following reasons:</p>
                    <ul class="unordered-list">
                        <li>It's hard to quantify how comfortable someone feels. What does it mean to feel 5 stars vs 2 stars of comfortable or safe?</li>
                        <li>The app feels like a clone of the other rating apps, but with a few different categories. What's the real differentiator?</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>I utilized Google's design system, Material Design, with a customized 3 color scheme, to make the jump from grey-scale wireframes into mid-fidelity mockups. Another round of usability tests plus feedback from our instructor revealed some additional information:</p>
                    <ul class="unordered-list">
                        <li>Make on-boarding robust. That flow wasn't mapped out initially, but it's absence was a missed opportunity to reinforce who the target audience is.</li>
                        <li>Some people preferred viewing search results in a list and others the map. Having both those options was a good choice.</li>
                        <li>The entire friends concept was not important enough for the MVP. I initially thought that would be important for the sharing aspect, but that didn't turn out to be true.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>

                    <h3 class="text-heading">Final Version</h3>
                        <p>Taking into account the results of the usability tests, I iterated on the existing screens and added an onboarding flow.</p>

                        </div>


                    <h3 class="text-heading">Further Improvements</h3>
                        <p><strong>Test the untested.</strong> There were elements, like onboarding, that didn't go through a round of usability tests.</p>

                        <p><strong>Niche experience.</strong> If this were a live project and/or the class had lasted a bit longer, at least one more round of iteration would help bring out the ways in which Enclave could really feel like a unique app for a GNC audience.</p>

                        <p><strong>Professional polish.</strong> The final version of my app as of the end of the GA course is a mid-fidelity mockup. It's starting to look and feel real, but doesn't have the polish or visual sophistication of a professional mobile app in 2019. Given time constraints and that my professional background is in analytics and engineering rather than visual design, I had to prioritize working on functionality over UI enhancements.</p>

    <!-- Key Takeaways start -->
            <div class="container philophy_text">
                <h2 class="text-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <p><strong>Get frequent feedback from customers.</strong> I can't say for certain what Enclave would have looked like if I had proceeded on only my own instincts without user feedback. Not without inventing a time machine to explore that alternate path, which feels like both overkill and a waste of a time machine. I can say that every time I talked with users, I learned something that helped shift my strategy in ways I wouldn't have come up with solo.</p>

                    <p><strong>Get feedback from others with more experience than you.</strong> One of the most valuable parts about doing the General Assembly course was the regular feedback we got from our instructor, a seasoned Design professional. In addition, the final product was evaluated by a group of other Design and UX pros with decades of experience collectively. All of that input was critical not just in shaping the development of Enclave, but in identifying my own UX strengths and weaknesses to be mindful of as I continue on this path.</p>
