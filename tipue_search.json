I have degrees in Geography and Urban Planning, which explains my particular interest in mapping applications. When not writing code, you can often find me reading. Sometimes I update my Goodreads account. I love to travel. Montreal is one of my favorite cities. I would love to visit Hong Kong, Morocco, and Peru in the not too distant future. In first grade I played the groundhog in our class play. My ability to predict the weather hasn&#39;t improved since then. I cannot accept that peanut butter is not it&#39;s own food group, and work actively to correct that state of affairs.",
