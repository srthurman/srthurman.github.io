            <p>A new approach to how the integration fundamentally works, with both an updated workflow and UI. The new approach should eventually apply to all destinations, with Adobe Analytics serving as a test case.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a> allows customers to send their data to 250+ downstream destinations, including Adobe Analytics (AA). AA is one of the most popular tools among enterprise customers given its' power, customizations, and suite of tools. To accommodate customers AA requirements, the Segment destination accumulated over 30 settings, many of which were interdependent. Customers had to do extensive manual testing when setting up and tweaking AA settings given the confusing situation. I worked with the lead designer, PM, and engineering team to design high-fidelity mock-ups, evaluate workflows, and run usability tests.</p>

<!-- Phase 1 start -->
        <div class="philophy_text container">
            <h2 class="text-heading">Phase 1: User Research</h2>
                <p>Our team had extensive feedback from customers regarding AA woes courtesy of our Customer Success and Sales teams. Consolidating that feedback highlighted the following pain points:</p>
                <ul class="unordered-list">
                    <li>More flexibility is needed to send along data in the correct format.</li>
                    <li>Settings are unclear. What exactly is going to happen if a setting is changed? Do other settings impact how a given setting behaves?</li>
                    <li>Settings are messy. All 30+ are presented in a long list, all on one page.</li>
                </ul>
        </div>
<!-- Phase 1 end -->

<!-- Phase 2 start -->
        <div class="philophy_text container">
            <h2 class="text-heading">Phase 2: Interaction Design</h2>
                <p>Based on the user pain points and ideation sessions with our team, we came up with the following goals for our new approach:</p>
                <ul class="unordered-list">
                    <li>Allow customers to define unique settings for each type of data.</li>
                    <li>Provide an on-boarding flow to guide users through the various settings.</li>
                    <li>Group settings in a logical way, and without overwhelming users by presenting them all at once.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unique settings per data type was the element requiring infrastructure changes. After discussing with the engineers how that would work under the hood, our lead designer came up with the initial designs and workflows.</p>
        </div>
<!-- Phase 2 end -->

<!-- Phase 3 start -->
        <div class="philophy_text container">
            <h2 class="text-heading">Phase 3: Usability Testing & Iteration</h2>
                <p>We entered into usability testing with a goal of understanding more about how customers use AA, and how that impacts their needs within Segment. The information from Success and Sales helped drive the initial ideation, but now it was our chance to talk directly with customers.</p>
                <p>I recruited participants from existing customers (coordinating with Success Managers) and conducted remote usability tests with five sets of customers across eight sessions. I ensured each session included a designer, the PM, and at least one engineer.</p>
                <p><em>Note: I don't have permission to show the intermediary screens, as those may be re-used for subsequent changes to other Segment destinations.</em></p>

                <h3 class="text-heading">Key Findings from Usability Testing</h3>
                    <ul class="unordered-list">
                        <li>Customers didn't actually need the ability to have unique settings for each type of data. The functionality changes needed for flexibility in sending data could fit into the existing architecture.</li>
                        <li>Changing the UI to make settings interdependencies more clear and improving copy was a big hit.</li>
                        <li>The on-boarding flow got a lukewarm response. It was nice, but customers didn't feel it added much beyond the new UI.</li>
                        <li>Most customers needed to make changes to one particular setting several times a month.</li>
                    </ul>
        </div>
<!-- Phase 3 end -->

<!-- Phase 4 start -->
        <div class="philophy_text container">
            <h2 class="text-heading">Phase 4: Rollout to Production</h2>
                <p>Since the architecture changes were no longer needed, that eliminated the largest technical component of the project, and thus a lot of the risk as well. That meant we could move much quicker to rollout the changes to all customers, making everyone happier.</p>
                <p>Once the UI changes and the minor functionality tweak were ready, we rolled it out to our testers first. Once they verified that everything was working as expected, we updated AA for all existing customers. There are plans to make this type of UI change to all other destinations.</p>

<!-- Phase 4 start -->
        <div class="philophy_text container">
            <h2 class="text-heading">Key Takeaways</h2>
                <p><strong>Iteratively testing mock-ups saved an estimated 60 engineering hours.</strong> That's not including maintenance, just initial build time. </p>
                <p><strong>Iterate after each usability test when testing opportunities are rare.</strong> Between coordinating with Customer Success Managers on which customers we could talk to and finding times when all relevant parties could meet, we had limited testing opportunities. As such, we immediately incorporated important feedback from each usability testing session before showing the mock-ups to the next customer.</p>
                <p><strong>Get engineers involved early.</strong> By being involved in the design and testing from the beginning, engineers end up having more buy-in to the end decision (they're part of it vs being told what to do), and they gain a deeper understanding of how customers use the products they build. As a side bonus, customers LOVE having access to engineers.</p>
